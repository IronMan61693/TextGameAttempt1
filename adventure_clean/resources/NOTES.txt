NOTES for game

Current project:
	-Random generation
		-I could make a dictionary of all of the tile types I want in the area
		-The key will be the name of the tile to be used and the value is how many
		-Of that tile I want to be placed
		-Furthermore I can have a function called generate which uses probability to place the next tile
		-Upon placing the tile the value goes down, I would either
			-Need a check once it is picked to ensure the value is at least 1
			-Or remove the key from the dictionary when the value hits 0 so it is not even an option
				-I could just use for ___ in tileDict but I don't know how I could weight which tiles will be placed
				-Maybe I don't and just allow any tile that is left to be placed next to any tile.
				-Would this lead to too difficult enemies being placed near the beginning.
					-Maybe I have which tile set is used change when the previous tile set is finished
					-I could have multiple dictionaries with varying difficulty of enemies which can be drawn from.
					-Furthermore I can have more tiles in a dictionary than will be used which means there is not
					- always a guarantee that every tile will be placed. Basically have a count and as the count moves
					- have which dictionary is drawn from change. 

		-Each dictionary should have:
			-One boss
			-One nice loot
			-One vendor NPC
			-One Nemesis NPC
			-Several blank tiles
			-A way out tile
			-Lots of enemy tiles
			-Some difficulty appropriate gear tiles

		-Have two dictionaries one which holds the possible tiles, and one that is the tiles used
			-Have the tile themselves hold the x,y coordinates, the player class can hold its xy
			- Then if the player moves I can check if there is a key x,y in the dictionary and if there is
			- Use that instances, otherwise generate one of the random tiles from the first dict
